tee commnad used to print output on screen and store the same in a file at same time
e.g
$ cat a* | tee out.txt
$ cat out.txt
a1
a1
Note that cat: a1: Permission denied does not appear because it belongs to
stderr. The tee command can read from stdin only.

creating alias
$ alias install='sudo wget install'


The alias command is temporary; aliasing exists until we close the current terminal
only. To keep these shortcuts permanent, add this statement to the ~/.bashrc
file. Commands in ~/.bashrc are always executed when a new shell process
is spawned:
$ echo 'alias cmd="command seq"' >> ~/.bashrc
