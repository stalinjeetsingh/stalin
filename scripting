PS1 is the envirnment varibale. We can customized it
to change our inital login text in terminal
It is define somehere in basgrc
$ cat ~/.bashrc | grep PS1

user@localhost: ~$ PS1="PROMPT>"
PROMPT> Type commands here # Prompt string changed.

tee commnad used to print output on screen and store the same in a file at same time
e.g
$ cat a* | tee out.txt
$ cat out.txt
a1
a1
Note that cat: a1: Permission denied does not appear because it belongs to
stderr. The tee command can read from stdin only.

creating alias
$ alias install='sudo wget install'


The alias command is temporary; aliasing exists until we close the current terminal
only. To keep these shortcuts permanent, add this statement to the ~/.bashrc
file. Commands in ~/.bashrc are always executed when a new shell process
is spawned:
$ echo 'alias cmd="command seq"' >> ~/.bashrc

**********************************
read -p "enter your name" (to prompt)
read -s -p enetr your name (to prompt and not displaying anything while we type on screen)
read -n 5-p "enter your name" (to prompt and to limit input to 5 char)

by default the read command store the varibale in REPLY varibale
echo $REPLY
otherwise you specifiy you own variable
read -p " enetr your name" Myname
now varibale will be stored in Myname

$ read -t 2 var
#Read the string that is typed within 2 seconds into variable var.
